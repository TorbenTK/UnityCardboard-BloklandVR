GOAL OF THIS REPOSITORY
==================================================
The code was written for a two week spanning 'hackathon'. The goal was for students to show their skills and to demonstrate what can be made in the span of two weeks.

I wanted to experiment with Google Cardboard, and the powers of Virtual Reality. My goal was not just to prove that it is not that hard nowadays to create a good Virtual Reality application, I also wanted to show how cheap and easy it is to actually get started. That is why I used only open source code, programs and tools: everything can be modified by anyone without having to pay tons of money, and no copyright issues.

To give you an idea of the costs of this project (excluding workhours, SmartPhone and consumption):

> Google Cardboard: about €10 ($15). Unity, Android SDK, Cardboard SDK, Android Studio: FREE.


So yes. About fifteen bucks will get you this far. A cheap way to develop!

IS THE CODE COMPLETE?
==================================================
The code runs without any errors or warnings. However, the code was written in two weeks, so certain aspects of the code are written twice or could've been simplified. There are a few bugs and glitches while running the project - either on Unity or on an Android SmartPhone - but they are minor, and not game breaking.

I am currently not planning to update the code with an improved version. However, if I do have plans, I will create a new repository to leave this one intact for anyone who has recently used the code.

RUNNING CODE
==================================================
REQUIREMENTS:
> Unity (4.6+), Android SDK (Android 4.1.2 and higher is required), Google Cardboard SDK

To get the code to run, download the prerequisities listed above. Once you've done that, install everything. Also import the downloaded API's to Unity, otherwise you will face only error messages.

Open the project, and then use Build & Settings to construct an .APK for any Cardboard compatible smart device. When doing that, do not forget to set the Orientation to 'Landscape' in the Settings tab! Also, don't forget to list your company/your name in the AndroidManifest.

You can also test-run the project in Unity itself: hold ALT and click while playing to turn off Virtual Reality.
